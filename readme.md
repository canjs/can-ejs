**DO NOT USE - NOT PRODUCTION READY**

Legacy Embedded JavaScript (EJS) view layer for CanJS. While this code has been heavily tested and is considered stable, it is no longer supported. CanJS now ships with [Stache](https://canjs.com/doc/can-stache.html) which is much more feature rich and much faster â€” you should use it instead!
